-- Project Overview -- 

This project is a simple Cafe ordering app developed in Android Studio. It takes advantage of the classic Model View Controller design pattern.
All of the code in this project is written by me using Android Studio tools, it requires an Android emulator to run but provides a strong example of
my general java abilities.
